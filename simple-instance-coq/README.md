A Coq development accompanying the "Beyond Good and Evil" paper
===============================================================

This Coq development shows that the simple compiler from Section 4 of
the "Beyond Good and Evil" paper satisfies an instance of Structured
Full Abstraction that by Theorem 3.4 implies Secure Compartmentalizing
Compilation. This formalization corresponds to Theorem 4.7 in the
paper and is done *under the same assumptions* as the proof sketch
from the paper (and the extended hand proofs from `simple-instance.org`).

This development is known to compile with Coq 8.5.
