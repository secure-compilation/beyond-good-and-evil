Accompanying Coq development to "Beyond Full Abstraction"
=========================================================

This development is known to compile with Coq v8.4 (at least version
8.4pl5).

The definitions of structured full abstraction are in the file
"fullabst.v". "context_language" and "structured_context_language"
comprise the basic language definitions needed to state the
property.

The "seccomp.v" file defines the basic notions of a compartmentalized
language and the "secure_compartmentalization"
property. "sfa_implies_sc" shows that, if structured full abstraction
holds for a compartmentalized language, then secure
compartmentalization also does.
